# Alamaan Website Admin Panel Leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While searching through Google, I came across the **admin control panel** of the Alamaan website. This panel contains sensitive information about the site. I am unsure if this data is real or accessible to unauthorized users, so I am reporting it to the official team.  

The admin page is:  
`https://alamaan.com.pk/admin/dashboard.aspx`

Below are the features and sections of the admin panel that are visible:
